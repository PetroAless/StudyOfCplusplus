C++ review of knowledge

types of operations:
--pointer expressions, refer to function "void pointer"
can be used with arrays to point to another variable,
eg: int arr[] = {...};
    int *ptr =arr;
    cout << *ptr // output:arr[0]

--bitwise expressions
can be used to change the value to the bit
eg:
int x=5; //in 8 bits :00000111
x=x>>1; //x in 8 bits now:00000011 (3)
x = <<2; //x now:00001100 (12)
can have its uses

--special expressions
-chained assignments
a=b=14;//a=14, b=14

-Embedded Assignment
a=10+(b=12);//a=22,b=12

-compound assignments
a+=10;

--goto
jump statement to a certain label
label:
    ...
    goto label;

weird TYPES
--lvalue
reference to another var:
int x =0;
int &y=x; //now &y has value of x and references to the address of x

pointers can be set in a function's signature, to change teh value of 
vars passed by reference eg: myFunc(type *myVar){...}
myFunc(&anotherVar);
very useful!
